The buttons use our accent red colour to create contrast between the black and white images and the coloured elements.
- The standard buttons are for banners, cards, forms and pages and where the background is a dark colour
- The light buttons are for light background areas
- The ghost buttons shouldn't be used on banners where the background is an image
- The no buttons are for actions like cancel
- The yes buttons are for actions like next and submit
